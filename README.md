# AIM : Airport Inventory Management 
Our hack SIH Hack for Airport Authority of India that makes equipment management a piece of cake by integrating QR code technology :)

## ABOUT :
Managing an aiport is not among the easiest tasks to handle. We felt that ~~10 trained human beings~~ **an app** will be enough to manage this humongous amounts of data related to thousands of equipments present at an airport.

We present before you _AIM : Airport Inventory Management_ that will allow one to login from their exclusive IDs to check, edit, add and export every crucial piece of info such as its serial number, date of manufacture, date of purchase, model, department, maintanance details, and much more! Now, before if it starts feeling too clumsy, we have organised it in such a manner that you will only see the data that you want see (see?).

So how is it different, you may ask. Well, we have made it all so much fun and easy because anybody with _valid login credentials_ and this small app in their smart-phone (whose phone isn't today? ;) will only have to do so much as to **scan a QR code** present on the equipment and every detail they require will be present on the screen. After a person has done their mantainence work, they just need to edit the concerned data and woosh, their change is **stored on the cloud** and ready for the reference of the next person.

## FEATURES :
- Exclusive login credentials for everyone.
- An easy to use interface which shows the details you want to see.
- Everything is **stored on the cloud**; thus data is safe as well updated instantly.
- Increases **transparency** among staff as everyone can see the data (can be controlled by admin).
- Shows edit history.
- Uses QR code technology replacing the cumbersome serial number input requirement to get data.
- Pictures can be added will aid the maintainence staff in finding out the problem as well as for others to report the problems.

## FUTURE PROSPECTS :
- Will increase the work efficiency by many folds as the exact same and updated data will be present with every team member.
- The data connected to the cloud can be used to set reminders of the next service date as well as allow the financial department to keep a check on how many equipments they have and will need.
- Will reduce the requirement of man force as data is no longer required to be maintained in the primitive _record books and directories_.
- Brings the chance of typing errors and and human errors to zero.
- Any dicrepency could tracked down to the person who edited the data.
- The data can be easily shared to other departments and other airports as well.
- If encorportated on a large scale, could be used to manange things other than equpipments as well as the app is very versatile.

## TO-BE ADDED FEATURES :
- Language support for staff that isn't well versed in english.
